#Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.
#In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation!
#Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!
#To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:

#1. Find the mean:

#(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4

#2. For each value: find the difference from the mean:

#32 - 77.4 = -45.4
#111 - 77.4 =  33.6
#138 - 77.4 =  60.6
#28 - 77.4 = -49.4
#59 - 77.4 = -18.4
#77 - 77.4 = - 0.4
#97 - 77.4 =  19.6

#3. For each difference: find the square value:

#(-45.4)2 = 2061.16
# (33.6)2 = 1128.96
# (60.6)2 = 3672.36
#(-49.4)2 = 2440.36
#(-18.4)2 =  338.56
#(- 0.4)2 =    0.16
# (19.6)2 =  384.16
#4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:
#(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2
